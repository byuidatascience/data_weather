# Scripts

This folder contains the scripts that were used to both download/clean the data along with create the visualizations. 

## tmy3_Master.R
This script is used to scrape all the tmy3 files from the National Solar Radiation Data Base website and combine it into a csv. The script is dynamic and does not require any additional changes to be made. Simpley run the script which takes several hours. For convenience we have placed all the data that this script downloads into the tmy3 folder grouped by state.
