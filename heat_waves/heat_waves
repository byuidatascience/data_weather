- 30 year period of weather data, most recent 1981-2010
- Used by utilities, agriculture, renewable energy, etc


Can we just exclude cooler months of the year like Dec, Jan, and Feb?



How do we figure out what data works best for heat waves?
- Combination of temperature and humidity
Can use given data and just focus on tepmerature/humidity combinations
