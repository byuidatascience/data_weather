# data_weather

This repository contains all the weather data that has been gathered and prepared for further analysis. 


#What are TMY3 files?

The TMY3s are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories.
